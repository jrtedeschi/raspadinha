# WebScraper Raspadinha
Hi, 

this is my YouTube webscraper, I call it raspadinha, named after a kind of lottery tickets (in Brazil) that you need scrape to see the winning numbers.

What this scraper can do is extract video information from YouTube, and upload data to JSON files to a MongoDB database, or just saving it locally on your machine. All code is on src. Enjoy
